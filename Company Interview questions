Features of Java8

----Synechron 1st -- given 
different type of class loader
call run method of runnable interface with functional programming
jvm jdk jre.

notify vs wait
@Restcontroller is in mvc
collection vs collections
call functional interface with lembda exp
how StringBuffer is thread safe.: methods are synchronized so only 1 thread can access.
rabitmq exchange, messge read lost?: in Rabbitmq messages are send to exchange which routes them to queue. lost messages can be handled using manual acknowledgements (autoAck=false), so unprocessd messages are requeued.
